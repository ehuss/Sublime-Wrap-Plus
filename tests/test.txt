#. Automatic numbered list example. We'll make some happy little bushes here. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.
3) Numbered lists can use parenthesis.  Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Here's something that's fun.
45678. Numbers can be quite large.  We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Use your imagination, let it go.
A. Lettered lists are similar to numbered lists.  Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Every time you practice, you learn more.
** Bullet item can have multiple characters.  Topping muffin cupcake cotton candy soufflé cake pie.
